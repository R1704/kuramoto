# 🚀 Kuramoto Extensions & Interaction Guide

An integrated handbook that documents the interactive controls and lays out a reprioritized roadmap for the next generation of Kuramoto extensions. Use the **Interaction Primer** to operate the current sandbox, and the **Roadmap** to decide what to build next.

## Interaction Primer (updated)

- **Draw / Erase (GPU-side)**
  - Hold **Cmd+Drag** to draw random phase seeds; **Cmd+Shift+Drag** to erase. Works in **both 2D and 3D** and no longer fights camera panning (camera ignores Cmd).
  - 2D view: fixed canvas, scroll zoom anchors to cursor, min zoom = 1× canvas; **double-click** resets zoom/pan. 3D view: Cmd-drag stops orbit/pan.

- **Scale field (K modulation)**
  - Sliders modulate effective coupling **K** spatially: base, radial, random, and ring terms combine then clamp to 0.1–5×. Higher values stiffen local sync; lower values loosen it.

- **Flow field (phase advection)**
  - Radial/rotate/swirl/bubble/ring/vortex/vertical add signed bias to phase rate (after dynamics/input). Range widened to ±5 for visibly stronger advection patterns.

- **Orientation map (anisotropy)**
  - Radial/circles/swirl/bubble/linear terms anisotropically scale phase updates (0.05–8×) to favor certain directions; strongest impact near boundaries/gradients. Acts like spatially varying diffusion.

- **Color = Data Layer × Palette**
  - Two selectors: **Data Layer** (Phase, Velocity, Curvature, Order, Chirality, Phase+Grad, Image) and **Palette** (Rainbow, Viridis, Plasma, Inferno, Twilight, Greyscale). `C` cycles palettes, **Shift+C** cycles data layer.

- **Phase space plot**
  - Unit-circle scatter remains behind `P` toggle; sampling is throttled and piggybacks RC readbacks where possible.

- **RC input modes**
  - Pick `freq_mod`, `phase_drive` (torque), or `coupling_mod`; shader switches injection path without rebuilds.

- **Saving settings**
  - URL updates with encoded params; bookmark/share to preserve state.

## Prioritization Framework

Priority is based on impact on research/UX, novelty, time-to-value, and implementation effort. Tiers help scope work; ranks are global across tiers.

## Critical Review & Implementation Plan (from RC/criticality audit)

- **Couple criticality to RC performance**: Run explicit K-sweeps per task and plot NRMSE/memory vs K alongside R, χ. Add this as an experiment preset.  
- ✅ Added RC K sweep (button) to sample NRMSE across K values for current task/regions.  
- **Add a spatiotemporal benchmark**: Include at least one 2D task (moving dot/bar prediction) to justify the 2D reservoir.  
- ✅ Added moving-dot spatiotemporal benchmark (dynamic input weights + future-position target).
- **State representation limits**: Phase-only Kuramoto lacks guaranteed fading memory; document this and optionally add leak/amplitude variants.  
- **Feature design and conditioning**: Add feature-budgeting (projection or temporal filters) to avoid ill-conditioned RLS; monitor covariance condition number.  
- ✅ Added feature budget with stride downsampling and condition estimate display (diag(P)).  
- **Input injection modes**: ✅ Implemented `freq_mod`, `phase_drive` (additive torque), and `coupling_mod` as selectable injection schemes.  
- **Stats clarity**: Label χ as temporal fluctuation proxy; add local R histograms to avoid over-compressing spatial structure.  
- ✅ χ labeled as temporal variance proxy; added live local-R histogram (fixed readback).  
- **LLE scope**: Treat LLE as offline/advanced; rely on R/χ/gradients for primary regime detection.  
- **UX for tasks**: Provide task presets and automated plots (NRMSE vs time/K) instead of manual eyeballing.

These items map onto the roadmap tiers below; the highest leverage is coupling RC performance to K and adding the spatiotemporal benchmark plus input-mode variants.

## Dependencies & Ordering

- Start with **T1** items; they unlock better UX, diagnostics, and sharing, and they are prerequisites for meaningful evaluation of deeper changes.  
- Implement **Graph Topologies** before **Hebbian** or **Hierarchical Layers** to avoid rewrites.  
- Ship **n-D Vectors** before **True 3D Grid**; the vector math and visualization patterns generalize to volumetric cases.  
- **Chimera Detection** and **FFT** rely on stable stat/IO pipelines built in earlier tiers.

---

## Acceptance Criteria Snippets

- **Save/Load**: Round-trip preserves θ/ω/params within FP tolerance; loading mismatched versions shows a friendly warning.  
- **Order History**: No more than 1–2 ms CPU per frame at 256×256; plot can be paused; export CSV.  
- **Graph Topologies**: Small-world sync transition demonstrable; max-degree overflow handled gracefully.  
- **Hebbian**: Weights remain bounded; visualization updates without dropping FPS >10% at 256×256.  
- **n-D Vectors**: S² spiral/defect demo runs at target FPS on reference hardware; color legend included.

## Publishing & Sharing Checklist

- Provide presets for each major extension (graph small-world, Hebbian memory, S² spirals).  
- Add short tooltips for every new control.  
- Update README and on-screen help once a tier ships.  
- Include a reproducible “demo script” (sequence of slider changes) for recording/export tests.
